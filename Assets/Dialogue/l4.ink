You look around outside and can find no signs of life. The city is quiet and still. A few small animals run around and it seems as if plant life is beginning to overtake the city. You run to a car nearby in the middle of the street. It sits near a couple cars that crashed together. You try and turn it on but it doesn't have any gas- as if it ran out from being stalled for too long. In the passanger seat is a small white earbud, which has exodus's company symbol on it.
