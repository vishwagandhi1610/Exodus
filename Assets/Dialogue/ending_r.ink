Entity tells you not to be afraid- that their life forms have come to save the world and that you'll be safe now. Your body is only holding you back so you won't need it any more and your consciousness will be uploaded to their higher realm. You don't trust it and you resist, but it's too late now. Everything fades to black. You wake up in a white cell again, a lot like the first description of this game. Someone comes to serve you food. You'll be here forever, and they will take care of you. You neededn't fear any more. Because all you need to do is exist for them.
