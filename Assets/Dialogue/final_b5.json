You were just an entry-level hire!","\n","^Nonmatter the answer, curiosity has gotten the best of you, and you step inside.","\n","^Upon closer inspection, the shelves around the room are vacuumed sealed- much like the glass containers in the old fashioned museums you’ve been to.","\n","^Inside lie a number of strange metal disks. They almost looked like the CD rom disks the ancients used to store information on. What would Exodus be doing with a bunch of old artifacts? And why are they so important to preserve?","\n","^One case stands out above the rest, a disk in a case at the center of the room. You read the placard below it:","\n","^“Documentation of First Contact with MV-84, December 15th 2304. Information download informing creation of the SimuLoad beta-test”","\n","^First contact? That sounds like one of the old alien sci fi shows you used to stream on your grandparent’s television. Who was MV-84? And what happened 17 years ago?","\n","^The other disks seemed to be dated later, all coming from this same “MV-84” source, which was somehow related to Exodus’s newest product, the SimuLoad earphone devices. Had someone else been teaching us how to make them?","\n","^You find yourself backing away from the dozen or so disks, ducking out the other door. The room left you with more questions than answers.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"0.18.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":"0.c-0","flg":2},{"s":["^…Well, you’re officially spooked…",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":"0.18.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],{"#":"selection:0"},"end","\n",{"->":"0.g-0"},{"#f":5}],"g-0":["done",{"#f":5}]}],"done",{"#f":1}],"listDefs":{}}
