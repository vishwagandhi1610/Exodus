You half expect the elevator's inner panel to be littered with millions of little buttons. But to your surprise, there are only three to choose from. You look up and see a dirty old security camera looking down at you. Someone must be watching. You know you're not supposed to be there. So you haven't got much time.
* choose button 'R'... -> level_R
* choose button 'L'... -> level_L
* choose button 'B'...-> level_B

=== level_R ===
-> END
=== level_L ===
-> END
=== level_B ===
-> END
