This fight feels right to you. In fact, you think it may have been the real reason you joined Exodus in the first place. It’s time to bring this company to its knees once and for all. 

You decide to spend the night in the office building, resting up for a long journey and collecting supplies that the militia left behind. And as the dawn breaks across the frosty concrete jungle, you know you’ve made the choice of hope. You may not have all the answers right now…but sometimes that’s the safest option there is. 

+ ...THE END...-> END
